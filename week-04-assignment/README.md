This assignment was very interesting to go over different types of bolding lines and even italicizing them. Adding links was brand new for me, so both email links and website links were informative. The ordered and unordered lists were very fun to make and interesting to experiment with.

All of these are going to be incredibly helpful especially the hyperlink section of this lesson. My website designer I'm inspired by is Nicolas MÃ©nard and his URL to his website is
http://www.nicolasmenard.com . He is able to set up links to different pages on his website for other sections of his portfolio.
