        The animation Blue Boy is an avant-garde animation appraoch to addressing the effects of man and the environment.
Symbols of leadership in both realms can be seen through our human perspective as man at the top of the food chain.
In nature and its ecosystems, there are many different creatures at the top of the food chain, one of them being the polar bear.

        The mechanical perspective that we adorn as a soceity leaves us to decision-making that is derailing the environment. Humanity
is taking resposibility by advocating on a voiceless behalf. The mroe time that goes on, the belief sticks that we are the rightful voices and
representatives of nature. While some fight this perspective, it is overwhelming how grim the future looks for a humanity that agrees to disagree while
we continue to be representatives for all. We are ambassadors with a foolish tendency to fight solutions.
