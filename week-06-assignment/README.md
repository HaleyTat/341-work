<!--  --> 341 week-05-assignment README.md

The first thing I noticed during this week's module, is that there are many different ways to organize and gather information using HTML5 and two different ways to access a database like using "get" and "post". I also learned about how an HTML form works and the different obstacles it goes through to process just one submission. I could surmise before that a web server is used to pass the information through, but I didn't know that there is a form processor script with it. It makes sense since the web server needs some type of script to specify what needs to happen next.

Another interesting aspect to this assignment is getting more in tune in learning what web browsers support most code, such as Firefox and Chrome, and what web browsers that lack in displaying some features of HTML5 like Safari.
