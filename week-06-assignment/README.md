<!--  --> 341 week-06-assignment README.md

This week's assignment has been the most interesting to work with now that classes have been introduced. The different methods to add media to a webpage is such an great process to learn. In my homework assignment. By far the most interesting aspect to the media was the posterphoto addition to the video. It all makes sense especially when I look at Youtube videos who seem to have poster photos already.

Classes are still interesting to me and I don't know if I quite understand the abilities of it, other than the ability to keep code clean and organized. All of them were labeled with different names, and are those names referenced throughout the document by id or the class name. This is where I seem to be stumped. I didn't add audio to my webpage since I already had a lot of images and a video on loop. I didn't want the page to be overrun and chaotic, so I added different variables that bring variety and are sourced from my own files on my computer.
