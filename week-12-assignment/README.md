<!--  --> 341 week-09-assignment README.md

    This README is for my part one of my final project for MART341.
I plan on programming a website that is more mobile-user friendly.
I'm going to be using flex boxes and drop downs. I plan on this page
being the rough draft of a future professional website that I
can build from the ground up for my artwork.

    I plan on having at least 3 different index.html links that
will include images from my portfolio as well as some videos of
my animation work. I plan on including a contact page, but I
might need some help making sure that the inner-working mechanics
of it work.

    I'm going to try and see if I can include sliding down menus
on the dropdown option. My color palette is inspired by another website from an architecture firm, which I will include the attachment in my repository.
