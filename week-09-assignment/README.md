<!--  --> 341 week-09-assignment README.md

    This homework was extremely difficult. The drop down menu was the hardest part especially with the hidden elements. The excitement about now being able to style with css is great though!! I had a love hate relationship with this assignment because of the ability to use css and then the difficulty with drop down menus.

    Something I am interested in doing for future assignments is having linked .html pages so the drop down menu does not have dead links. I am overly-excited about being able to start building a website for my art from scratch and experimenting with the new styling abilities that I've learned from this week.

    Keeping track of all of my classes or id's to reference for styling was a challenge, so that's something organization-wise that I can improve on for next week.
