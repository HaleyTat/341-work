<!--  --> 341 Final Part 2 README.md

    In this README.md, I'm going to discuss my ideas for the next stage of my final project.
I want to have the content drive my RWD, and my content will be various media, such as videos and photos.
I want to use illustrations and other content that I have developed in other classes to build a professional
-looking website. I have changed my color palette around a bit than what I originally planned. I want
my site to look clean and easy to follow.
    I plan on adding break points and continuing the design for my content according to mobile interface.
All of my content I plan on adding will be media based, so it is going to be a lot trickier with the breakpoints
and having it set up well for good RWD.
