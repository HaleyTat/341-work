<!--  --> 341 week-10-assignment README.md

    This README is dedicated to the second part of my final project for MART341.


    What is RWD?
It is Responsive Web Design. Responsive Web Design is all about accommodating to other devices sizes and browsers,
so that your content flows well and functions well for the user no matter what kind of device or browser it is
being accessed from. This includes breakpoints and flex boxes to allow the design to work well within the
boundaries.

My process for RWD is to have the content drive my decisions and then I can assume where I want my breakpoints
to occur, and what type of flex boxes to use such as flex-wrapping my text.

My flex box operations wasn't my main focus for this assignment. My main focus was adjusting breakpoints in
4 areas.

        the first information on the page should be the content of the heading.

        The primary content of this page is the about for my art page. It describes
        in detail, my focus on art and what my passion is in investigating art.

What is the secondary content?

        The secondary content could be other places of possible navigation. The primary content is pretty
        much the only content on the page besides the heading. It could possible be "Haley Tatalovich Art",
        but either could count as secondary content.
