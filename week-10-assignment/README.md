    This README is dedicated to the second part of my final project for MART341.


    What is RWD?
It is Responsive Web Design. Responsive Web Design is all about accommodating to other devices sizes and browsers,
so that your content flows well and functions well for the user no matter what kind of device or browser it is
being accessed from. This includes breakpoints and flex boxes to allow the design to work well within the
boundaries.

My process for RWD is to have the content drive my decisions and then I can assume where I want my breakpoints
to occur, and what type of flex boxes to use such as flex-wrapping my text.
