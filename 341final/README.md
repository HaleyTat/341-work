<!--  --> 341 week-10-assignment README.md

    This README is dedicated to the third part of my final project for MART341.

    My process for phase three was quite the ordeal. i planned on doing a few links, but it was like a rabbit
hole that I would get stuck on with each of them. I mean it was thoroughly enjoyable. I loved getting to style things and build this from the ground up. My color palette ended up changing, as did my other ideas for the content. I actually took a lot of my material from my wordpress and loaded it into my site.

    Unfortunately, I only made my main page good for RWD (works in Safari but not Chrome for whatever reason),
but I know that I'm going to keep building on this site after I'm done with this class. This website Design
was just too fun to go on with styling. Obviously there were some frustrating parts, such as the drop down menus, it's ALWAYS THE DROP DOWN CONTENT that is SO frustrating. However, It all worked and I'm very pleased with a
lot of the outcome especially for the other links on my page. Not all items in the dropdown have links, but
for the ones that do, I couldn't be more thrilled with the very real practicality I took with this final
and adding my own personal content for a future website for my art.
